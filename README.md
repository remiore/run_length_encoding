In computer science, compression is a method of storing data such that its storage takes less space than the data itself. Run Length Encoding (RLE) is a simple form of compression, often used for bitmap images. The idea is, if you look at each row of pixels in an image, if several adjacent pixels have the same value, you can encode something like "the next 10 pixels have value x" and it ends up saving space.
RLE is a form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. This is most efficient on data that contains many such runs, for example, simple graphic images such as icons, line drawings, Conway's Game of Life, and animations.
